# Jets Application
## Overview

This program simulates an airfield in which the user can display a list of aircraft and view their traits such as name, speed, range, and price.

### Technologies used

Array lists, Conditionals, Java, Loops, Scanner, Switches.

### How to run:

User will select an option from the menu.

The application will either display all jets, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view jet with longest range, or close the program, depending on the user input.

### Lessons learned

I learned how to implement a buffered reader into an array list, how to properly use array lists, and how to call upon several objects from an application.
